# TSettlers

TSettlers is a reinforcement learning bot made for SWEN 711 class at RIT. It
uses Jeremy Monin's JSettlers2 code base as a library to develop and train a
DQN bot.

## Directories

The project was split into two primary projects, EchoJ and EchoPy where EchoJ
is the java bot interface with JSettlers and EchoPy is the backend AI. There is
a scripts folder that was used to auto-launch various enviornments for testing
through IntelliJ's run configurations.
